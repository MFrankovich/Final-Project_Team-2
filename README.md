# Team 2 - Final Project


- [x] 1) Prepare new CSS for each of three pages 
- [x] 2) Enhance at least one page using one of the jQuery plugins provided in Ch. 19
- [x] 3) Publish your site on the SABAL webserver and on GitHub pages
- [x] 4) Prepare and deliver a 10- to 15-minute presentation to the class during the final exam period

------

## Guidelines & Rules:

\- In general, you may NOT modify the HTML source code directly EXCEPT as needed to:

- Implement the jQuery enhancements described in Chapter 19 of your book
- Add a "favicon" to each page (optional, for extra credit)
- Occasionally I may give permission to add or modify *attributes* of HTML elements, but you **must ask me for permission to do so**

------

==**- Update [added 12/4/2018]:**==  **I will allow you to make changes directly to the HTML for adding NEW elements to a page and for modifying MOST of the existing elements.** In addition, I will still require you to use jQuery to modify the DOM to add at least one element and to modify the content of at least one element on **each** of your pages.  

------

 \- You ARE permitted to use jQuery to modify the DOM (i.e., to add or  update elements). (This will be demonstrated in class, but you can  refer  to http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/dom-insertion-outside/) 

\-  You ARE permitted to use CSS to add content to an element (see p. 271  in your book, but also  see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after)
\-  You ARE permitted to use CSS and/or JavaScript/jQuery to rearrange  elements on the page. Some of this will be demonstrated in class after  we return from Thanksgiving break.
\- All pages MUST be responsive! No exceptions. If your page is not fully responsive, **your team will earn no higher than a "C" on this project**, no matter how good your page looks in desktop mode!
\-  You will all work together as a team, but in general, each person on  your team should be primarily responsible for one page. If your team has  four team members, then the 4th team member can either be teamed up  with someone else to work on one page, or if your team is adding the  "Admissions & Aid" page for extra credit, the 4th team member can  work on that page

\- How you choose to divide and manage your work is up to you. A  general checklist of specific deliverables will be provided over break,  but beyond that, it's up to you. 

\- As far as managing files is concerned, consider using DropBox,  OneDrive, and/or Google Drive to share files with each other. Designate  one person on the team to be responsible for a "master copy" of the  files as they are modified, and **that person should be committing and pushing work up to Bitbucket regularly (at least once a day!!)**. *(If you're up for it, you can use  the team-based tools in Git for creating branches, checking out files,  merging, etc., but I suspect this will cause more harm than good for  most of you.)*
\- As with your other Bitbucket repositories, the "master copy" of your Bitbucket repo must be shared with me (**doctorcanada**, with **admin** access) immediately after you create it. If you wish to give all team members access, you are welcome to do so.
\-  In order to ensure that everyone is doing his or her fair share of the  work, there will be a "peer assessment" process towards the end of the  project. Each team member will complete a short questionnaire where you  will rate yourselves (and each other) as to the degree to which team  members were contributing equally. This may factor into your individual  grade for the project, so please be a good team player: show up to and  participate in team meetings, encourage others to participate more if  needed, and when tasks are assigned, do what is expected of you. *Any conflicts among team members should be discussed with me personally, preferably during office hours.*
\-  To give yourself the best chance of your team getting an "A," do your  best to adhere to the design guidelines in Ch. 17, and strive for visual  consistency across ALL three (or four) pages
\- Your designs must  be SUBSTANTIALLY different from the current USCB website. Simply  swapping out colors and fonts is NOT enough (but it's certainly a  start). Add images! Add content! "Hide" any content you think is  unnecessary, or rearrange elements on the page. Be creative (while still  adhering to good page design guidelines)!
\- Look for  high-quality, high-resolution images on the web, and/or take your own  photos if you wish! Use Photoshop, GIMP, or other tools to resize your  images for your website (see Chapter 11 for suggestions on how to work  with images for the web)
\- YOU MUST USE lowercase_letters IN ALL  FILE AND FOLDER NAMES (this is important for when you migrate your site  to the SABAL webserver).
\- NEVER USE SPACES IN FILE OR FOLDER NAMES -- use-hyphens-or_underscores_instead

## Extra Credit opportunities:

==\- **Update [12/4/2018]:**== Use **only** jQuery to add or modify elements to a page -- that is, the *only* changes you make to the HTML *manually* would include adding HTML to the **body** section to implement the jQuery enhancements described in Chapter 19 of your book as well as any changes to the **head** section for linking CSS files, including JavaScript/jQuery files (with a .js extension), adding a "favicon" to each page, etc.
\- Create and add a "favicon" to each page
\- Use a jQuery plugin that is NOT given in your book

\- Create and add the "Admissions & Aid" page 

*- More to come!*
